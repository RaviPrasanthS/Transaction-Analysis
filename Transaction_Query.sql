/*This SQL analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the credit card transaction data. 
It covers various aspects such as total transactions, transaction trends over daily, weekly, and monthly periods, peak transaction days, 
and merchant analysis including identifying top merchants by transaction count and total transaction amount. 
Additionally, it analyzes merchant categories, card holder patterns, and offers insights into customer segmentation based on transaction behavior. 
Overall, this analysis facilitates informed decision-making, risk mitigation, and strategic planning for business growth */
